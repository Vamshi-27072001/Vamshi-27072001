# 🚀 Aspiring Data Analyst | Master's Student in Computer Science

Hi there! 👋  
I'm currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science** at the University of East London and have a keen passion for uncovering insights through data analysis and visualization. During my internship at **Innodatatics**, I developed a **K-NN clustering algorithm** with 96% accuracy, now used for monthly analysis of 500+ SKUs in supply chain management. I’ve also worked on **volunteering experience** and **personal projects**, where I applied Python and SQL to explore various data patterns and insights.

My technical toolkit includes **Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel**, with Tableau and Power BI being self-taught through online resources. I'm now actively seeking **internship opportunities as a Data Analyst** to apply my skills, tackle real-world challenges, and contribute to impactful projects. Let’s connect and create data-driven solutions together!
